# ATM

## Description
This project was created as part of the MITxPro program in full-stack web development. This is a basic ATM program that allows for deposits and cash back. Improvements included not allowing the user to take more cash back than was deposited. 

## Future improvements
In the future, I would like to improve the styling of the document to make it more user-friendly.
